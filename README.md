Introduction

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, trained on a small dataset to classify binary outputs. The primary goal is to demonstrate the fundamental operations of neural networks, including feedforward pass, backpropagation, and gradient descent, without relying on any external machine learning libraries.
Features

    Feedforward Neural Network: Implements a neural network with one hidden layer and a sigmoid activation function.
    Backpropagation: Includes manual implementation of backpropagation for weight and bias updates.
    Training and Evaluation: Trains the network on a small dataset and evaluates the performance using mean squared error (MSE) loss.
    Visualization: Plots the training loss over epochs for visual evaluation of the training process.

Technologies Used

    Python
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-from-scratch.git
cd neural-network-from-scratch

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install numpy matplotlib

Usage

    Run the neural network training script:

    bash

    python neural_network.py

    The script will print the loss at every 10th epoch and display a plot of the training loss over epochs.
